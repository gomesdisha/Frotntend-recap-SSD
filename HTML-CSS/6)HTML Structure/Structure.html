<!-- The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page.= Represents the entire web page.Designed for nesting all other HTML elements.

    everything inside the html page is part of either the head or body element.:

     The <head> element contains meta-information about the document, such as its title and links to stylesheets.(not visible on page) eg:<title>, <meta>, <link> etc.

     The <body> element contains the (visible elements) content of the document, such as text, images, and other media. 
     
     Here we have nested tags, i.e. head,body inside html-->
